# Inventory
My Inventory Node.js project.

I have created this project for educational purposes. It is a starting point for me to learn node.js and some surroundings such as mocha, npm and other.

To install the repository (on a Mac OS X)
First execute "git clone https://github.com/matsskoglund/Inventory.git" in a folder.
cd into Inventory ("cd Inventory")
Run "npm install" to install required libraries.
Run "npm start" to start the server
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see firstpage
While the server is still running, open a new terminal window, cd inteo "Inventory" folder and execute "npm test" to run the tests.
